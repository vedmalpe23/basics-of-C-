This repositor contains a collection of basic c++ programming assignments completed as a part of my college coursework. 

Program 1: Introduction Program
Description:
This is a simple introductory program written in C++ that prints a message to the console. It demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program, including the use of the #include directive for input/output and the main() function. This program serves as a foundational example for understanding syntax, output statements, and basic compilation.

Key Concepts:

1) #include<iostream> for input/output operations
2) std::cout for displaying output
3) Basic main() function and return statement

Program 2: Inputting Two Numbers
Description:
This program prompts the user to input two integer values from the keyboard. It introduces the concept of input handling in C++ using cin, along with variable declaration and basic user interaction.

Key Concepts:

1) Declaring integer variables
2) Taking user input using cin
3) Displaying prompts using cout
4) Use of using namespace std

Program 3: Basic Calculator Program
Description:
This program functions as a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two user-provided floating-point numbers. It demonstrates variable declarations, arithmetic operators, and formatted output in C++.

Key Concepts:

1) Using float and int for variable types
2) Reading input from the user
3) Performing basic arithmetic operations
4) Displaying results clearly using cout

## Objective

To understand the basic structure of a C++ program and how to display output using the `cout` statement.
